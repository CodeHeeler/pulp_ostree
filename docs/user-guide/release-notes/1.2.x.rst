- The importer has the capability to pull using a user specified tree traversal depth.
  This is controlled using the ``depth`` property in the importer configuration. The traversal
  depth determines how much of the commit history is pulled. For example: a depth of 3 will
  cause the newest 3 commits to be pulled for a given branch.

- The distributor has the capability to publish using a user specified tree traversal depth.
  This is controlled using the ``depth`` property in the distributor configuration. The traversal
  depth determines how much of the commit history is published. For example: a depth of 3 will
  cause the newest 3 commits to be published for a given branch.


API Changes

  This controls to tree traversal depth when pulling remote refs and when publishing trees.
  A depth of ``0`` (the default) specifies that only newest commits are pulled and published.
  A depth of ``-1`` is used to specify an unlimited depth.

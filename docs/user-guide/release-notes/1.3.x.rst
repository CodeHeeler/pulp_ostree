Pulp OSTree 1.3 Release Notes
=============================

Pulp OSTree 1.3.0
=================

New Features
------------

- The importer's algorithm for creating content units has been enhanced.
  A content unit is created for each branch HEAD commit. The importer then walks up
  the commit ancestry and creates content units for each parent commit. This ensure there
  are no gaps in the branch history. The tree traversal ``depth`` may limit how much of the
  history is available.  The importer does not support cases where the remote repository has
  used ``ostree reset`` to update a branch HEAD.

- The CLI now supports the ``depth`` option which is used to configure the tree traversal
  depth for both the importer and distributor.
